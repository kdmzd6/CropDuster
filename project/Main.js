  <p>Second Paragraph</p>
  <p>Yet one more Paragraph</p>

<p>  "First  Rule:  People are stupid; given proper motivation, almost anyone will  believe  almost anything. Because people are stupid, they will believe a  lie  because they want to believe its true, or because they are afraid  it  might be true. People’s heads are full of knowledge, facts,  and  beliefs, and most of it is false, yet they think it all true.  People are  stupid; they can only rarely tell the difference between a  lie and the  truth, and yet they are confident they can, and so are all  the easier to  fool."
 </p>
 <p> "Second Rule: The greatest harm can result from the best intentions." </p>
  <p> "Third Rule: Passion rules reason."</p>
  <p> "Fourth  Rule:  There is magic in sincere forgiveness, the magic to heal.  In  forgiveness you grant, but more so, in forgiveness you receive."</p>
  <p> "Fifth Rule: Mind what people do, not only what they say, for deeds will betray a lie."</p>
